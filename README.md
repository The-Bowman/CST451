## CST451-452

# General
This project was created as the Capstone Final Project for GCU course CST-451/452
The Project Portfolio is in the DOCUMENTATION folder at the root of the master branch which 
includes implementation plans, test cases, and additional design documents including mock up
wireframes and other design elements. Additional documentation for each Main folder and class
included in them, aside for HTML views are also stored in this DOCUMENTATION folder in their
own respective folders.

# Purpose
The purpose of the project was to provide a new competitor to large corporation takeovers of
PC component specialty shops. The platform is to provide a way to access components at a fair
market price without worry about product going to the highest bidder or bots as has been seen
with the recent pandemic swings in the market supply chains.

# Implementation
This application was built using newer .NET6 Core technologies and utilizes Bootstrap 5.2 
to create a fast and simple to understand UI. The MVC structure of the application employs
n-tier layering and data separation in addition to client-side data validation to improve
response times and lighten the load on server-side processing. A thematic color approach
also exists to ease user interaction with the site. The user can quickly learn to look for 
a color rather than having to carefully read each component on the page to accurately 
interact with the application.

# A Note 
The appsettings.json file that contains the connection string for the database is setup for
local running only. If you choose to use the code here, this will have to be adjusted. I 
recommend setting up an AppSettings.cs or WebConfig.cs file and ignore the appsettings.json
when looking to use remote servers.
